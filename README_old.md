		Project Description				

##Why are we doing this?  

We got tons of good read in Open Mind Wechat group. But here are the questions:
Some might have read those “must-read” and they are willing to share books with others.
 But “OTHERS” don’t even know it.
Even though this ruthless world get them apart, but this is the right time to get them together!
Let’s make this happen!!!
